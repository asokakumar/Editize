  <h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
  <p>So you've just downloaded Editize and you're anxious to see what it can do, 
    right? In this section of the manual, we'll endeavour to get you up and running 
    as quickly as possible.</p>
  <h2>What You Need to Know</h2>
  <p><em>Editize</em> is a Web component designed to let Web developers create 
    more intuitive interfaces for editing HTML documents in Web-based content 
    management systems.</p>
  <p>Since <em>Editize</em> was designed as a drop-in replacement for the HTML 
    <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> tag, getting the most out of <em>Editize</em> 
    begins with knowing how to build useful Web applications with the <code>&lt;textearea&gt;</code> 
    tag and the server-side scripting language of your choice.</p>
  <p>If you've never written a server-side script or a database-driven Website 
    before, there are some things you need to learn before you can put <em>Editize</em> 
    to work for you. We would recommend picking up a copy of <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/">Build 
    Your Own Database Driven Website using PHP &amp; MySQL</a>, an excellent book 
    that will gently guide you through the process of server-side scripting with 
    PHP and MySQL. You can even download the first 4 chapters for free from the 
    book's Website!</p>
  <h2>What next</h2>
  <p>The various APIs for <em>Editize </em>are designed so that you can simply 
    replace any <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> tag with some brief code to place 
    an <em>Editize </em>field in its place. In server-side languages that support 
    it (e.g. ASP.NET), this code will take the form of an XML tag.</p>
  <h3><a name="section4sub1" id="section4sub1"></a>Available APIs</h3>
<p>The following server-side APIs for <em>Editize</em> are included in this distribution. 
  Select the one that best fits your needs to learn the exact code that will allow 
  you to use <em>Editize </em>on your site:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="asp/index.html">ASP</a></li>
  <li><a href="aspdotnet/index.html">ASP.NET</a></li>
  <li><a href="php/index.html">PHP</a></li>
</ul>
  <p>If you do not have access to a supported server-side language on your Web 
    server, you can use the <a href="javascript/index.html">JavaScript API</a> instead. 
    This API should work with any server-side language, including ColdFusion, 
    JSP, and Perl.</p>
  <p>Additional APIs will be released for free depending on user demand. <a href="mailto:support@editize.com">Let us know</a> what you need! </p>
