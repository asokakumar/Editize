  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.12 - October 30, 2007</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed: Pasting content from OpenOffice.org would fail.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.11a - March 16, 2007</h2>

  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.9 - February 22, 2005</h2>

    <li>The hyperlink dialog now contains a reminder that http:// is required on absolute URLs. </li>
    <li>Fixed: major memory leak caused <em>Editize</em> to allocate more memory every time it was loaded in a page. You must update <code>kunststoff.jar</code>, not just <code>editize.jar</code> for this fix to work. </li>
    <li>Fixed: typing Enter in a table cell inserted a space instead of a line break. </li>
    <li>Fixed: repeatedly inserting line breaks produces strange behaviour. </li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.8 - July 6, 2004</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All supported browsers now work with standard HTML submit buttons. Java submit buttons are now deprecated.</li>
    <li>New <code>endForm</code> method must be called for Netscape 4 compatibility and for HTML submit buttons to be submitted in some browsers (ASP, PHP, and JavaScript APIs only). See API documentation for details.</li>
    <li>HTML code output by <em>Editize</em> is no longer word wrapped.</li>
    <li>Improved robustness of license file checking in the face of non-critical HTTP errors.</li>
    <li>Bold (<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>) and Italic (<code>&lt;i&gt;</code>) tags in a loaded document are now recognized by the Bold and Italic buttons on the toolbar. These buttons still only create <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags, though.</li>
    <li>Fixed: Netscape 4 would crash when attempting to load or submit an <em>Editize</em> field larger than about 3KB.</li>
    <li>Fixed: <em>Editize</em> sometimes added spaces around inline tags on submission, causing unwanted spaces in the resulting document.</li>

    <li>Fixed: The default red colour of highlighted text was not being applied.</li>
    <li>Fixed: Selected text was not visible when a document background colour had not been assigned.</li>
    <li>Fixed: Line breaks would not display properly and text was incorrectly centered in newly-created tables when running in Java 1.3.1.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.10 - January 6, 2004</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Handling of document structure when deleting at the start/end of list items and other nested block strucutres has been greatly improved.</li>
    <li><em>Editize</em> now always includes an <code>alt</code> attribute in <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags, even if it's empty.</li>
    <li>Reduced appearance of confusing &quot;Plain&quot; paragraph type by showing &quot;Table Cell&quot; and &quot;List Item&quot; when the cursor is placed in blocks of these types.</li>
    <li>Improved caret/selection visibility when a background color is assigned. </li>
    <li>Disabled ASP.NET 1.1 automatic form submission validation in ASP.NET examples to allow for submission of HTML content.</li>

    <li>Fixed: In rare circumstances, PHP API could fail to load the initial document. </li>
    <li>Fixed: Create a hyperlink, begin typing, hyperlink stops after first character. </li>
    <li>Fixed: Line breaks in HTML code were stripped on input, sometimes causing a loss of significant whitespace when reading HTML from the form or the clipboard.</li>
    <li>Fixed: Color swatch on highlighted text icon was not being updated with assigned highlighted text color. </li>
    <li>Fixed: Insert Image and Insert Table dialogs could sometimes get lost behind the browser window.</li>
    <li>Fixed: System beep when opening certain dialogs (e.g. Insert Image).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.9 - September 12, 2003</h2>

    <li>Typing Enter in an empty list item will now end the list.</li>
    <li>Typing Enter in untagged (&quot;Plain&quot;) content will now insert a line break
        (<code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>) tag.</li>
    <li>Old style clipboard hotkeys (Shift-Ins, Ctrl-Ins, Shift-DEL) now supported. </li>
    <li>Fixed: Self-closing XHTML tags in clipboard content would cause spurious
    characters to appear when pasted.</li>
    <li>Fixed: Ghosted table edges would not be visible after pasting a
      table with no border from an external source (e.g. Excel).</li>
    <li>Fixed: Could not paste a portion of a paragraph copied from Word.</li>

      not work.</li>
    <li>Fixed: The Java submit button didn't work in Safari or Mozilla browsers
      for Mac OS X.</li>
    <li>Fixed: Internal submit button may not have displayed when requested under
      some conditions. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.8 - August 19, 2003</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Regression fixed: Compatibility with Java 1.4.2 restored.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.7 - August 15, 2003</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added full support for the Safari browser on Mac OS X.</li>
    <li>The filename extension of the license file can now be changed in the ASP,
      PHP, and JavaScript APIs as well as the ASP.NET API (see the <code>licensefileext</code>
      property in the reference for your API).</li>
    <li>The order of the indent and outdent buttons in the toolbar have been
      swapped to improve usability.</li>
    <li>Fixed: <em>Editize</em> could not edit an existing image until after a

    <li>Fixed: The Java submit button did not work in the ASP API.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.6 - July 4, 2003</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Fixed: A bug in the newly-released Java 1.4.2 caused <em>Editize</em>
      to display as a grey box.</li>
    <li>Fixed: The PHP API for <em>Editize</em> would not allow you to set a document
      background color unless you had also specified a base font face. This bug
      could also cause the applet to crash if you had <em>only</em> specified
      a base font face. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.5 - June 27, 2003</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><em>Editize</em> now lets the developer configure the background color
            displayed behind the document, to better match Web sites with colored
            backgrounds. Refer to the new 'bgcolor' attribute of your API of choice
            for further details.</li>
        <li><em>Editize</em> output is now fully XHTML compliant! <em>Editize</em>
            can also correctly read XHTML-compliant self-closing tags (e.g. <code>&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;</code>).</li>
        <li>You can now put more than one Java submit button on a page, identifying
            each with a name - just as you would normal HTML submit buttons. When
            the form is submitted with one of these buttons, a field with the
            specified name will be submitted. For example, you can create matching
            'Update' and 'Cancel' Java submit buttons using this feature. Refer
            to the new 'submitbuttonname' attribute of your API of choice for
            further details.</li>
        <li>Improved robustness of Image Insert. Uneeded attributes are no longer
            added to the document.</li>
        <li><code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tags replaced with
            <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags for better
            compliance with current standards.</li>
        <li>Fixed: <em>Editize</em> would not split a list item when the user
            pressed Enter.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.4 - May 16, 2003</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Submission on Mac OS X should be four times as fast as in previous releases.</li>
    <li><em>Editize</em> can now edit HTML code that is not surrounded with block
      tags. <em>Editize</em> will show the paragraph style of such content as
      &quot;Plain&quot;. This is useful for editing fragments of HTML intended
      for inline display.</li>
    <li>The &quot;Inset&quot; paragraph type has been removed and replaced with
      &quot;Inset&quot; and &quot;Outset&quot; buttons in the toolbar. This allows
      the user to create multiple levels of indented content, and to create indented
      headings, code blocks, etc. In a future release, these buttons will also
      allow the user to create nested lists.</li>
    <li>Typing a Tab while in a table cell will move the cursor to the start of
      the next table cell. When in the last cell of a table, typing Tab adds a
      new row to the bottom of the table.</li>
    <li>The &quot;About Editize&quot; item on the pop-up menu can now be hidden
      with the 'about' parameter in all four APIs.</li>
    <li>Opera 7 is now supported, in addition to Opera 6.</li>
    <li>Fixed: The developer-specified hyperlink color was being ignored.</li>
    <li>Fixed: &quot;Undefined is undefined&quot; error that was causing submissions
      to fail in some versions of Internet Explorer for Mac OS X.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.3 - March 22, 2003</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A new code signing certificate, valid until March 2004, replaces the
            one used on previous builds, which expires today.</li>
        <li>Debug output for paste operations that was added in the previous build
            has now been removed. See <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting
            </a>for details on the clipboard issue.</li>
        <li>Tables with a border size of 0 now have light gray, visible borders
            in the WYSIWYG view presented by <em>Editize</em>.</li>
        <li>All APIs now allow the developer to set the background color that
            appears around the applet if it has a non-rectangular outline (i.e.
            due to the 'WYSIWYG' and 'Code View' tabs, or due to the built-in
            Java submit button).</li>
        <li>The mouse cursor is now an I-beam over the WYSIWYG editing area, instead
            of a standard arrow pointer.</li>
        <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.5">16 standard
            HTML color names</a> are now recognized and supported by all color
            configuration properties.</li>
        <li>Fixed: The <code>showsubmitbutton</code> property in the JavaScript
            API was not being correctly processed.</li>
    </ul>  <h2>Changes in Editize 2.6.2 - January 31, 2003</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Editize</em> now intelligently &quot;scrubs&quot; HTML attributes
      added by Microsoft Word (and other Microsoft applications) when pasting
      from the clipboard. As a side-effect of this feature, <em>Editize</em> no
      longer supports the <code>style</code> attribute on any tags. Please contact
      support if this negatively impacts your application.</li>
    <li>Submitting a form with Editize's Java submit button will now correctly
      trigger and respect the return value of an <code>onSubmit</code> event handler
      assigned to the form.</li>
    <li>Added the <code><a href="aspdotnet/reference.html#licensefileext">LicenseFileExt</a></code><a href="aspdotnet/reference.html#licensefileext">
      property</a> to the ASP.NET API that allows you to give <em>Editize</em>
      license files a file extension other than <code>.lic</code>. This is to
      allow Editize to be deployed under IIS on Windows 2003 Server, where <code>.lic</code>
      files have a special meaning.</li>
    <li>Paste operations now output extensive debug information to the Java Console.
      This will assist support personnel in debugging issues with the clipboard.</li>
  </ul>
